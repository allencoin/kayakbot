#About
This is a Twitter bot that will check weather conditions in the Triangle, NC area once a day and tweet if it's a good day for kayaking.

Right now, it's just pulling in local weather data for Raleigh. 

##TODO:
- Expand to Durham and Orange counties
- Pull in water level data using the US Geologic Survey's API to get information about river conditions
- Include information about river conditions, or just recommend to stick to lakes. 
- If it's a bad day for kayaking, look ahead to tomorrow and tweet if tomorrow's conditions are favorable

##DON'T:
- Go chasing waterfalls
